# Iberian ceramic potteries

## Dataset
The raw information belong to binary profile images, corresponding to Iberian wheel made pottery from various archaeological sites of the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). 
Reference classification has been done by an expert group, based on morphological criteria, taking 
into account the presence or absence of certain parts, such as lip, neck, body, base and handles, and the ratios between their corresponding sizes.
According to these criteria, vessels can be classified as belonging to one of 11 different classes, each one with different number of elements. Nine of them
correspond to closed shapes, and the two remaining correspond to open shapes. The available images consist of a profile view of the pottery, where image resolutions (in pixels), corresponding to size scale, may vary according to the acquisition settings.

# Reconstruction of Iberian ceramic potteries using auto-encoder generative adversarial networks

## Abstract
Several aspects of past culture, including historical trends, are inferred from time-based patterns observed in archaeological artifacts belonging to different periods. Ceramic potteries are significantly helpful in this purpose, given their relative abundance in most archaeological sites. Nonetheless, most available pottery is fragmented, leading to missing morphological information. Currently, the reassembly of fragmented objects from a collection of hundreds of mixed fragments is manually done by experts. To overcome the pitfalls of manual reconstruction and improve the quality of reconstructed samples, here we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework tested on an extensive database with complete and fragmented references. Using customized GANs, we trained a model with 1072 samples corresponding to Iberian wheel-made pottery profiles belonging to archaeological sites located in the upper valley of the Guadalquivir River (Spain). We provide quantitative and qualitative assessments to measure the quality of the reconstructed samples, along with domain expert evaluation with archaeologists. The resulting framework is a possible way to facilitate pottery reconstruction from partial fragments of an original piece.
